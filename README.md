# Generate a Numpy Tableau from a LP

This tool generates a bytestream of a numpy matrix (tableau) containing
the standard for representation of the linear program specified in the passed-in mps file. 

The code in this repository builds on my code from the [lp-analyzer project](https://github.com/staadecker/lp-analyzer/).
